Actually I didn'nt chooose the Computer studies program because I don'have skills in Computer but I  fail passing the admission test that's why I'm Computer studies because I have no choice and I guess this is the fate between me and Computer Science and chance yo know more about in programming languages For now I'm still pursuing my dreams ,To become a professional someday and  to work abroad and  make my family happy and proud so they can buy what they want . </p>
